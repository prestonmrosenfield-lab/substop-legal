## 6. Third-Party Integrations

### 6.1 Gmail (Google)

SubStop may request read-only access to your Gmail account to detect subscription-related emails. By connecting your Gmail account, you authorize SubStop to access emails from known subscription senders only. This access is governed by Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can revoke access at any time at [myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

### 6.2 Plaid (Bank Connection)

SubStop uses Plaid to provide bank account linking functionality. By connecting your bank account, you agree to Plaid's End User Privacy Policy ([plaid.com/legal/end-user-privacy-policy](https://plaid.com/legal/end-user-privacy-policy)) and Terms of Use. SubStop receives only read-only transaction data — we cannot initiate transfers or access your full account credentials.

### 6.3 App Store / Google Play

In-app purchases are processed by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). Their respective Terms of Service and refund policies apply. SubStop has no control over purchase processing or refunds handled by these platforms.

---

## 7. Subscription and Billing (Premium Features)

### 7.1 Free vs. Premium

SubStop offers free and premium tiers. Free accounts have access to basic subscription tracking. Premium features (Smart Recommendations, Weekly Digest, Advanced Analytics, Export) require an active SubStop Premium subscription.

### 7.2 Payment

Premium subscriptions are billed through your App Store or Google Play account at the rates displayed at the time of purchase. Prices may vary by region and are subject to change.

### 7.3 Free Trials

If a free trial is offered, it begins on the date you start the trial. At the end of the trial, you will be automatically charged unless you cancel before the trial ends.

### 7.4 Cancellation and Refunds

You may cancel your Premium subscription at any time through your App Store or Google Play account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you retain access to Premium features until then. **We do not issue refunds** for unused portions of a subscription period, except as required by applicable law or App Store / Google Play refund policies.

### 7.5 Price Changes

We may change our subscription prices with reasonable notice. If you do not agree to a price change, you must cancel your subscription before the price change takes effect.

---

## 8. Intellectual Property

All content, features, and functionality of the App — including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, icons, and software — are owned by SubStop and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.

You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.

---

## 9. Financial Information Disclaimer

SubStop provides subscription tracking and spending analysis tools for informational purposes only. The App is **not** a financial advisor and does **not** provide financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. Any recommendations made by the App (e.g., "switch to annual billing," "cancel unused subscriptions") are suggestions based on your data and should not be relied upon as professional financial guidance.

Always verify subscription details (amounts, billing dates) directly with your service providers. SubStop is not responsible for inaccuracies in data sourced from third-party connections.

---

## 10. Disclaimers

THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

We do not warrant that:
- The App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure
- Results obtained from using the App will be accurate or reliable
- Any errors in the App will be corrected

---

## 11. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SUBSTOP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE APP.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR $10 USD, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.

---

## 12. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless SubStop and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with your use of the App or violation of these Terms.

---

## 13. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the App at our sole discretion, without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties.

Upon termination, your right to use the App immediately ceases. Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive, including intellectual property rights, disclaimers, and limitations of liability.

---

## 14. Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

Any dispute arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court, except that either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court for infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights.

**CLASS ACTION WAIVER:** You agree that any arbitration or legal proceeding shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class, consolidated, or representative action.

---

## 15. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last updated" date and, where appropriate, sending a push notification or email. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
